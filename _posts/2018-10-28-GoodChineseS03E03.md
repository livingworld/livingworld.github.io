He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.  In the first forty days a boy had been with him.  But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally **salao**, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week.

老人独自驾着小舟在湾流捕鱼，八十四天过去了，还一无所获。在最初的四十天里，有一个小男孩与他同行，但这四十天毫无收获，男孩的父母告诉他这个老人准是十足地 **salao**，这是用来描述不幸透顶的，于是男孩在父母的安排下，在另一艘船的第一个星期就捕获了三条不错的鱼。

It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast.  The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat. 

看着老人每天回来时，驾着他那艘空荡荡的小船, 男孩感到非常难过，他常常下去帮助老人拿盘绕的线或鱼叉，以及桅杆周围卷起的帆。用面粉袋打着补丁的船帆，收拢起来，看上去像持久战败的旗帜。

The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.

老人瘦瘦憔悴，脖子后有很深的皱纹。照射在热带海洋上的阳光带来的良性皮肤癌的褐色斑点出现在他脸颊上。这些斑点顺着他脸的两侧流淌下来，他的双手因用绳子抓重鱼而留下深深的伤疤。但这些伤疤并不新鲜，它们像无鱼可抓的沙漠里的侵蚀一般久远。

Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the samecolor as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.

他全身已经老的不行，除了那双眼睛，它们和海洋一样有相同的颜色，充满愉快且无法被打败。

"Santiago," the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. "I could go with you again. We've made somemoney."。

“圣地亚哥”，男孩对他说，在他们从小船被拖到岸边处爬上岸时，“我可以和你一起去海。我们赚了不少钱。”

The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.

老人教会了孩子捕鱼，海子喜欢老人。

"No," the old man said.  "You're with a lucky boat.  Stay with them."

“不，”老人说。“你遇上了一艘好运船，和他们待在一起吧。”

"But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks."

“但请记住，有一次你出海 87 天一条鱼都没捕到，然而之后连续三周，我们每天都能捕到一条大鱼。”

"I remember," the old man said.  "I know you did not leave me because you doubted."

“我记得，”老人说。“我知道你不会离开我，因为你满是疑惑。”

"It was papa made me leave.  I am a boy and I must obey him."

“是我爸爸让我离开的。我还是个孩子，我必须听从他们。”

"I know," the old man said.  "It is quite normal."

“我知道，”老人说。“这很正常。”

"He hasn't much faith."

“他没有太多信心。”

"No," the old man said. "But we have.Haven't we?"

“这个自然”，老人道。“但我们有，不是吗？”

 "Yes," the boy said. "Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we'll take the stuff home."

“是的，”男孩说。“我可以请你在露台上喝啤酒吗，喝好后我们再把这些东西带回家。”

"Why not?" the old man said. "Between fishermen.”

“好呀，”老人说。“渔民还会客气吗？”

They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the oldman and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked athim and were sad. 

他们坐在露台上，许多渔民取笑老人，但他并不生气。其它老渔民，看着他，很伤心。

But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlinout and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the otherside of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.

但他们并没有表现出来，他们礼貌地讲述了当前的线路和线路的深度以及稳定的天气及他们的见闻。那天成功的渔民已经回来了，他们已经屠宰好马林鱼，把它们平摊在了两个甲板上，每个甲板的末端都有两个人蹒跚地走进鱼屋，他们等待着冰床将它们运到哈维那。那些已经捕捉到鲨鱼的人已经将鲨鱼运到了小海湾另一侧的鲨鱼工厂，吊在滑车组上，它们的肝脏被移除，鱼鳍被切除，皮被剥去，肉被切成条腌制。
